## Exercise 1.8

Newton’s method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given by the value
$$\frac{\frac{x}{y^2} + 2y}{3}$$
Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root procedure.

**Ans**

```scheme
(define (cbrt x)
    (define (square x)
        (* x x))
    (define (split-3 x y)
        (/ (+ x y) 3))
    (define (improve guess)
        (split-3 (/ x (square guess)) (* 2 guess)))
    (define (good-enough? new-guess old-guess)
        (< (/ (abs (- new-guess old-guess)) old-guess) 0.001))
    (define (cbrt-iter guess last-guess)
        (if (good-enough? guess last-guess)
             guess
             (cbrt-iter (improve guess) guess)))
    (cbrt-iter (improve 1.0) 1.0))
```
