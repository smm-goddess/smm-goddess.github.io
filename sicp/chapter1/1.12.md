## Exercise 1.12

The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal’s triangle.

$$
1 \\
1 \quad 1 \\
1 \quad 2 \quad 1 \\
1 \quad 3 \quad 3 \quad 1 \\
1 \quad 4 \quad 6 \quad 4 \quad 1 \\
\ldots
$$

The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. Write a procedure that computes elements of Pascal’s triangle by means of a recursive process.

**Ans**

```scheme
(define (triangle level position)
    (cond ((or (= position 1) (= position level)) 1)
          (else (+ (triangle (- level 1) position) (triangle (- level 1) (- position 1))))))
```
可以得到任意一层任意一位数字的值
