## Exercise 1.16

Design a procedure that evolves an iterative exponentiation process that uses successive squaring and uses a logarithmic number of steps, as does `fast-expt`.(Hint: Using the obervation that $(b^{n/2})^2=(b^2)^{b/2}$, keep, along with the exponent $n$ and the base $b$, an additional state variable $a$, and define the state transformation in such a way that the product $ab^n$ is unchanged from state to state. At the beginning of the process $a$ is taken to be $1$, and the answer is given by the value of $a$ at the end of the process. In general, the technique of defining an $invariant\space quantity$ that remains unchanged from state to state is a powerful way to think about the design of iterative algorithms.)

**Ans**

```scheme
(define (fast-expt b n)
    (define (expt-iter n b a)
	    (cond ((= n 0) a)
		         ((even? n) (expt-iter (square b) (/ n 2) a))
				 (else (expt-iter b (- n 1) (* a b)))))
	(expt-iter b n 1))
```
